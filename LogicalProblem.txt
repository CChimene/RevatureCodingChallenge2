a) If the last day is a Wednesday there are 4 possibilities:
28 days in the month (February): the 14th is a Wednesday
29 days in the month (February in a leap year): the 14th is a Tuesday
30 days in the month: the 14th is a Monday
31 days in the month: the 14th is a Sunday

b) If the 17th is a Saturday, the 14th will always be a Wednesday

c) So long as II is true b) will always be the answer

d) II is always sufficient. If II is false, then the 14th is simply not on
a Wednesday regardless of whether I is true. I being true or false doesn't 
narrow it down much see a)

e) see c)
